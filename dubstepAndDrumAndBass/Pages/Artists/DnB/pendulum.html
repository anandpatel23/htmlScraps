<u><h1>Pendulum</h1></u>
<center><h2>Pendulum is an Australian-British drum and bass and electronic rock band founded in 2002 in Perth by Rob Swire, Gareth McGrillen, and Paul Harding.

Swire and McGrillen were members of the rock band known as Xygen. After hearing Konflict's "Messiah" at a club, they were inspired to enter into the drum and bass genre.  They founded Pendulum with Harding, who was a veteran DJ into the drum and bass scene. In 2003 the band relocated to the United Kingdom.

While Hold Your Colour holds true to the drum and bass genre, Pendulum have since experimented with mixing other genres into their work. This can be heard on In Silico and Immersion. Their newer releases incorporate styles from genres such as alternative rock, heavy metal, dubstep and house music.

Pendulum are also known for their live shows, with a live band setup and advanced visual displays adding to the incorporation of their infusion of drum and bass with rock.

Pendulum are currently taking a break from touring and live performances for approximately 18 months.<h2></center>
